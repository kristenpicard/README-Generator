# README Generator

## Description

A quality README with information about a project is important for other developers/users/viewers to know how to view and use your application. The README should also provide instructions on installation and oppotunitis to contribute in the future.

This project is a command-line application that utilizes Node.js to produce a ReadMe.md file using input from the user.

The command line will prompt the user for all of the sections needed in a good README file and create a .md file in response.

Clone the repository at https://github.com/kristenpicard/README-Generator and load it on code editor of your choice. Vscode is the prefered editor.

In the command line, the user can invoke the application with "node index.js."

## Usage

When the user invokes node index.js, then a series of quetions appear, requiring the user to type their applicable answers regarding their project.

After the last prompt, a ReadMe.md file is created using the information that the user provided.

If nothing is entered in a specific section then that section will appear empty apart from the tite of that section.

Depending on which License(s) the user chooses, the cooresponding badges and link to the license will display in the license section.

The ReadMe.md file will also take the GitHub username inputted and display it in the ReadMe.md file as a link to their GitHub profile.
